Build Process
=============

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
--------------------------

*$30* at http://www.microcenter.com/

A Raspberry Pi 3 is the computer that runs TJBot (together with Watson on the cloud). I bought mine from microcenter.

Raspberry Pi Camera Board v2

Mini USB Microphone

Mini External USB Stereo Speaker
--------------------------

$1.40 Speaker connector: Instead of a USB speaker, I ordered this part to allow me to plug in one of my existing speakers through the USB connector on the Pi from Alisexpress  I read in there somewhere that a USB speaker is better than using the 3.5mm jack on the Pi because with the Pi's audio jack you might get distortion.

Female/Female Jumper Wires - 20 x 3"
--------------------------

Jumper wires (see the parts list referenced above) : I have a bunch laying around that I bought from Aliexpress. For example, here are a bunch for just a few dollars at Aliexpress. (Aliexpress is like amazon or ebay ordering direct from China. You need to wait a long time, like a month, for things to come)

Female/Male 'Extension' Jumper Wires - 20 x 3"

5V 2.4A Switching Power Supply
--------------------------

NeoPixel Diffused 8mm Through-Hole LED - 5 Pack
--------------------------

*$10*  - https://www.adafruit.com/product/1734

I found mine for less by shopping around. You can find them on Amazon and ebay.  Shipping is expensive. Note: you can't use any old LED if you want it to work with the TJBot software without modification, it must be a neopixel LED and must be "through hole" which is a little more difficult to find and more expensive. You may even be able to get it from microcenter (mentioned above)


16GB Card with NOOBS 2.1
--------------------------

A Micro-SD card - I'm using a PNY 8gb class 10 card that I found at Walmart on clearance. The chart on this page (http://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards) tells which cards work best with the Pi3. The parts list calls for 16gb, but I'm using an 8gb card.

Noobs is available for download here.I just use my laptop to copy files onto the micro-sd card for the Pi.

TJBot Chipboard and frame
--------------------------

*$30 (including shipping)* at http://texlaser.com/

For the TJBot "Body" I decided to order a laser cut "cardboard" (It's actually a very thick cardboard almost like a child's board book). from Texaslaser.

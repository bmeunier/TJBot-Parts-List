Instead of a USB speaker, you could ordered this part that will allow you to plug in one of you existing speakers through the USB connector on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. Seem that a USB speaker is better than using the 3.5mm jack on the Pi because with the Pi's audio jack you might get distortion.

Or you can find them on Amazon and ebay.

Note: you can't use any old LED if you want it to work with the TJBot software without modification, it must be a neopixel LED and must be "through hole" which is a little more difficult to find and more expensive. You may even be able to get it from microcenter (mentioned above)

For the TJBot "Body" you can order a laser cut "cardboard". It's actually a very thick cardboard almost like a child's board book).
